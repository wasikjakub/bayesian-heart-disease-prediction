# Data Analytics

## **Repository for Final Project from Data Analytics Course**

### **Problem Formulation**
This project focuses on a classification problem to predict the likelihood of heart disease occurrence based on various human health parameters. These parameters include:

-chest pain type, </br>
-resting blood pressure, </br>
-cholestoral, </br>
-fasting blood sugar, </br>
etc. </br>

### **Data Source**
The dataset used for this project is sourced from a Kaggle notebook on heart disease predictions, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/desalegngeb/heart-disease-predictions/notebook).

### **Data Characteristics**
The provided data is divided into continuous and discrete forms. Continuous variables (e.g., resting blood pressure, cholesterol) will be handled using appropriate scaling techniques, while discrete variables (e.g., chest pain type, fasting blood sugar) will be encoded using suitable methods.

### **Confounding Factors**
Potential confounding factors that may affect the analysis include age, sex, and other health conditions. These factors will be identified and addressed in the modeling process to ensure accurate predictions.
